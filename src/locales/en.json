The only thing you have to do is write a secret, an “embarrassing” story, a revelation or anything else you can think of and we will publish it on the facebook group “DSA - Ein online Jahrbuch”. If you never reveal your name on the text you submit there is no way for us to know your identity, so your anonymity is secure. Of course anything you submit has to comply with the rules of the group."
